There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it (reality shows) gives them an opportunity.\" Aamir Khan, whose last film Dangal told the story of two girls who grow up to become formidable wrestlers, says his upcoming movie Secret Superstar -- a musical drama -- is yet another film on the empowerment of the girl child.The film revolves around a teenager who dreams of becoming a famous singer.?Both Dangal and this film are based on the same topic... That we look differently at our daughters. And probably we aren?t able to give the same treatment to our daughters as our sons. So, Secret Superstar is another film based on empowerment of the girl child,? Aamir said here when asked about the message that Secret Superstar carries for the society.The actor was present at the trailer launch of the film on Wednesday.Aamir, a father of three, feels the Indian film industry must make more films for children.?We should make more films for children. This film (Secret Superstar is for youngsters, but isn?t restricted to an age group. This is a family film... It has a wider scope. When our kids were younger, we used to show them foreign animated films which are only for kids. And that is definitely something we should do.?We don?t make enough films for kids in India,? Aamir said.Asked about the recent controversy surrounding children?s reality shows, ignited by filmmaker Amole Gupte, and spurred on by director Shoojit Sircar, Aamir weighed in.?Honestly, I haven?t seen those reality shows. But it cuts both ways (referring to kids getting platform to show their talent and they shouldn?t be overexposed). There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it gives them an opportunity. At the same time, we shouldn?t get so aggressive about it that we really rob them of their childhood,? Aamir said.After portraying the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal, Aamir will be seen in a very unusual avatar in Secret Superstar. He says he and his wife Kiran Rao were both very apprehensive about him taking up the role he plays.?When I heard the story for the first time, I loved it a lot. But Advait (director Advait Chandan) asked me to play Shakti Kumar?s character. I told him I couldn?t see myself in that role. Kiran also didn?t want me to do this role.?So, I decided to go through the screen test process. Then while doing the screen test, I had fun and this was a very unusual character, completely opposite of me. So it proved to be a challenge for me as an actor to make the audience believe in the character.?Kiran, who has co-producer the film, also spoke about not wanting Aamir to play the role.?I told him not to do this role as (I felt) he won?t be able to do it. It?s kind of a creepy character... He is a kind of guy who you really don?t want to hang out with alone in a room. So I told him, ?Please don?t do this role as it will be very weird to do such a character after a film like Dangal?.?But when we went through the screen test, we laughed so much that we were convinced he can do this role too. But he wasn?t the original fit.?When asked about the 100% success rate of his films on the box office and his secret for it, Aamir said: ?We just make films we believe in. I am just very fortunate with the films that we have made, the writers and directors that we work with and the talented people that come to us with the films that they want to make.?Somehow it all works out well in the end. I don?t know if it?s anything else to it other than the fact that we believe in what we make and we work with people who are very talented.?Secret Superstar also features Zaira Wasim along with Meher Vij. The film will release in October.Follow @htshowbiz for more</td>\n",

Further claiming that India has already lost 250 languages in last five decades, the survey said, \"Each time a language is lost, the corresponding culture is killed.\" More than half of the languages spoken by India's 1.3 billion people may die out over the next 50 years, scholars said on Thursday, calling for a concerted effort to preserve the tongues spoken by the nation's endangered tribal communities.The People's Linguistic Survey of India (PSLI) raised the alarm during the launch of the latest 11 volumes in its planned 50 volume survey of the country's languages. India's people speak as many as 780 different languages, the PSLI said.\"At least 400 Indian languages are at the risk of dying in coming 50 years,\" GN Devy, the chairman of PSLI, said.Each time a language is lost, the corresponding culture is killed, Devy said, adding that India had already lost 250 languages in last five decades.The group of scholars and teachers at PSLI documents Indian regional languages in order to conserve cultural heritage and diversity.Most at risk are marginal tribal communities whose children receive no education or, if they do go to school, are taught in one of India's 22 officially recognised languages.\"Maithili, which is spoken in the eastern state of Bihar, is at least 1,000 years old. Similarly there are several old languages which are surviving somehow in India, but we are hardly passing them on,\" said political psychologist Ashis Nandy.Devy said the PSLI will start work on a project to document about 6,000 living languages spoken around the world.

There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it (reality shows) gives them an opportunity.\" Aamir Khan, whose last film Dangal told the story of two girls who grow up to become formidable wrestlers, says his upcoming movie Secret Superstar -- a musical drama -- is yet another film on the empowerment of the girl child.The film revolves around a teenager who dreams of becoming a famous singer.?Both Dangal and this film are based on the same topic... That we look differently at our daughters. And probably we aren?t able to give the same treatment to our daughters as our sons. So, Secret Superstar is another film based on empowerment of the girl child,? Aamir said here when asked about the message that Secret Superstar carries for the society.The actor was present at the trailer launch of the film on Wednesday.Aamir, a father of three, feels the Indian film industry must make more films for children.?We should make more films for children. This film (Secret Superstar is for youngsters, but isn?t restricted to an age group. This is a family film... It has a wider scope. When our kids were younger, we used to show them foreign animated films which are only for kids. And that is definitely something we should do.?We don?t make enough films for kids in India,? Aamir said.Asked about the recent controversy surrounding children?s reality shows, ignited by filmmaker Amole Gupte, and spurred on by director Shoojit Sircar, Aamir weighed in.?Honestly, I haven?t seen those reality shows. But it cuts both ways (referring to kids getting platform to show their talent and they shouldn?t be overexposed). There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it gives them an opportunity. At the same time, we shouldn?t get so aggressive about it that we really rob them of their childhood,? Aamir said.After portraying the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal, Aamir will be seen in a very unusual avatar in Secret Superstar. He says he and his wife Kiran Rao were both very apprehensive about him taking up the role he plays.?When I heard the story for the first time, I loved it a lot. But Advait (director Advait Chandan) asked me to play Shakti Kumar?s character. I told him I couldn?t see myself in that role. Kiran also didn?t want me to do this role.?So, I decided to go through the screen test process. Then while doing the screen test, I had fun and this was a very unusual character, completely opposite of me. So it proved to be a challenge for me as an actor to make the audience believe in the character.?Kiran, who has co-producer the film, also spoke about not wanting Aamir to play the role.?I told him not to do this role as (I felt) he won?t be able to do it. It?s kind of a creepy character... He is a kind of guy who you really don?t want to hang out with alone in a room. So I told him, ?Please don?t do this role as it will be very weird to do such a character after a film like Dangal?.?But when we went through the screen test, we laughed so much that we were convinced he can do this role too. But he wasn?t the original fit.?When asked about the 100% success rate of his films on the box office and his secret for it, Aamir said: ?We just make films we believe in. I am just very fortunate with the films that we have made, the writers and directors that we work with and the talented people that come to us with the films that they want to make.?Somehow it all works out well in the end. I don?t know if it?s anything else to it other than the fact that we believe in what we make and we work with people who are very talented.?Secret Superstar also features Zaira Wasim along with Meher Vij. The film will release in October.Follow @htshowbiz for more   \n",

The state electricity department is investigating the unit consumption and will amend the bill if necessary. Bhosle claims of receiving similar bills in the past for the bungalow that is mostly locked. Maharahstra Power Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Tuesday ordered the officials of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) to inquire into the complaint of inflated bills by legendary singer Asha Bhosle. Bhosle was stumped after receiving an electricity bill worth over Rs 53,000 for her unused bungalow in Lonawala.\"Shocked\" over the power bills, the 83-year-old singer approached Mumbai BJP President Aashish Shelar, who then took up the issue with Bawankule, requesting his intervention in the matter.BHOSLE GOT SIMILAR BILLS EVEN EARLIERBawankule assured Shelar that his department would investigate the unit consumption and make amends if necessary. Bhosle has received similar bills in the past for the same bungalow that remains locked for most of the year.Also read |  Maha assures action in hefty power bill claim by Asha BhosaleBut Opposition parties have attacked the government over the issue, alleging that the state government is only working for celebrities.  \"This is totally laughable.

Further claiming that India has already lost 250 languages in last five decades, the survey said, \"Each time a language is lost, the corresponding culture is killed.\" More than half of the languages spoken by India's 1.3 billion people may die out over the next 50 years, scholars said on Thursday, calling for a concerted effort to preserve the tongues spoken by the nation's endangered tribal communities.The People's Linguistic Survey of India (PSLI) raised the alarm during the launch of the latest 11 volumes in its planned 50 volume survey of the country's languages. India's people speak as many as 780 different languages, the PSLI said.\"At least 400 Indian languages are at the risk of dying in coming 50 years,\" GN Devy, the chairman of PSLI, said.Each time a language is lost, the corresponding culture is killed, Devy said, adding that India had already lost 250 languages in last five decades.The group of scholars and teachers at PSLI documents Indian regional languages in order to conserve cultural heritage and diversity.Most at risk are marginal tribal communities whose children receive no education or, if they do go to school, are taught in one of India's 22 officially recognised languages.\"Maithili, which is spoken in the eastern state of Bihar, is at least 1,000 years old. Similarly there are several old languages which are surviving somehow in India, but we are hardly passing them on,\" said political psychologist Ashis Nandy.Devy said the PSLI will start work on a project to document about 6,000 living languages spoken around the world. The report is scheduled to come out by 2025.ALSO READ:Know interesting facts about Hindi the official language of IndiaBengaluru: Pro-Kannada group demands removal of Hindi boards, threatens to blacken them   \n",
